Marketing Campaign Analysis 📊
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes marketing campaign performance to understand why business growth has stagnated for over two years. The goal is to determine whether the issue is caused by customer churn, ineffective acquisition, or low conversion performance, and to provide actionable insights for decision-makers.

🎯 Problem Statement
Business growth has been stagnant for 2+ years, and it is unclear whether this is due to:

Losing existing customers (churn)
Failing to acquire new customers
Inefficient marketing spend
🎯 Objectives
Using a dataset of ~10,000 records, this analysis aims to:

Analyze revenue per customer
Calculate customer churn rate
Evaluate new customer acquisition cost (CAC)
Compute average order value (AOV)
Measure conversion rates
Identify high-performing and underperforming marketing channels
🧑‍💼 Stakeholder
Marketing Manager
Needs data-driven insights to:

Optimize marketing budget
Improve customer retention
Increase ROI from campaigns
🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas – data manipulation
NumPy – numerical analysis
Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization













Problem Statement: Our growth has been stagnant for 2+ years, and we don't know if its due to churning old customers or failing to gain new customers. 

Objective: We will analyse this dataset of 10k records and find out different insights on our data, for ex:
        A) Revenue by each customer
        B) Churn rate of each customer 
        C) New Customer Acquisiton Cost (CAC)
        D) Average order value
        E) Conversion Rate of each customer 

The Stakeholder: The Marketing Manager (who needs to know where to spend the budget).
